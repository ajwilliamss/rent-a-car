# Rent a Car Application

Full stack application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node).

# Summary

Any user visiting the site can view the list of cars on the home page. There are options to filter the cars by price or by brand. Additionally, a user can search for a specific car by typing the brand or model name in the search bar. Admin users can add cars, delete cars or edit car listings. All users have the option of updating or deleting their account.

In order to go to the individual listing of a car and book it, a user must be logged in. When they are logged in and on the listing, they can select the rent duration and will be given an amount based on the total hours and fee per hour. There is also an option to view all the bookings for each car when the show bookings button is clicked. Once the pay amount button is clicked, the user is taken to their booking's page, where a list of all bookings is displayed.
